This is a math problem.
1 = 1sq2
121 = 11sq2
12321 = 111sq3
...
... and so on.

Now, of course, (int('1'*i))**2 could have worked, but we are not allowed to use strings. So, here is something else:
1111 = 10pow0 +10pow1+10pow2+10pow3.

These terms are the sums of a geometric series of form
Using the formula to sum the geometric series, we get:
sn = 
So essentially, each line, we print .
Here is the code.

for i in range(1,int(input())+1):
    print(((10**i-1)//9)**2)
